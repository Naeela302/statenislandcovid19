<p> On the borough of Staten Island, COVID rates fluctuate and continue to be unpredictable.
The borough has been struggling with keeping COVID rates low and disgruntled residents not wanting to wear a mask. In November the Staten Island Advance published a story stating that the highest percent positivity on the island was 5.04% and just a month later it went up to 8.7%. The lowest percent of infection became 5.8%.</p>

<p> COVID related deaths increased to 67 which makes it the highest its ever been since May. The Staten Island Mall is located at 10314, where COVID is at it’s highest. According to the city’s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene <a href=https://www.silive.com/coronavirus/2020/10/wearing-your-mask-oddo-city-hall-set-record-straight-on-staten-island-compliance.html>only 45% of Staten Island residents are wearing masks.</a> However, this data was not thorough because it was a small survey that wasn’t conducted over a wide range of time.
